## Project Overview

Salifort Motors has tasked us with analyzing employee data to predict which employees are likely to leave the company and identify contributing factors. This project utilizes data analytics and machine learning techniques to assist HR in formulating data-driven retention strategies.

**Key Objectives:**
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on HR data.
2. Develop and evaluate a machine learning model (Decision Tree Classifier) to predict employee turnover.
3. Provide insights and recommendations to improve retention rates.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 15,000 records and the following columns:
- `satisfaction_level`: Employee satisfaction (0â€“1 scale).
- `last_evaluation`: Performance review score (0â€“1 scale).
- `number_project`: Number of projects the employee worked on.
- `average_monthly_hours`: Average hours worked per month.
- `time_spend_company`: Years with the company.
- `work_accident`: Whether the employee had a work accident (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- `left`: Turnover status (1 = Left, 0 = Stayed).
- `promotion_last_5years`: Promotion status in the last five years.
- `department`: Department the employee worked in.
- `salary`: Employee salary level.
